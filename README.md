🚀 SmartPay Series – Episode 2: Securing the Backend with ASP.NET Core Web API 🔐
In this episode of SmartPay, I’m diving into the backend development of my digital wallet system, ensuring secure user authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity and JWT tokens.

🔹 Tech Stack for the Backend: ✔ ASP.NET Core Web API – Backend services & authentication
✔ IdentityDbContext – Managing user authentication
✔ JWT & JWTBearer Authentication – Secure token-based authentication
✔ UserManager & SignInManager – Handling user registration and login

✅ Features Implemented So Far:
🔐 User Registration & Login – Secure sign-up & sign-in with email verification
🔑 JWT Authentication – Generating access tokens for users
🔄 Token Refresh Endpoint – Allows users to refresh their authentication token
📩 Email Existence Check – Prevents duplicate registrations

🛠 Key Components:
✔ JwtService – Handles JWT creation for authentication
✔ UserDto, LoginDto, RegisterDto – Data transfer objects for clean API communication
✔ AccountController – Manages user authentication





🛠 Testing with Postman
I’ve been using Postman to test the API endpoints for registration and login to ensure that everything works as expected. It allows me to verify the correct handling of requests and responses, ensuring the JWT token is properly generated and authenticated.

🔥 Next Steps (Episode 3 Teaser):
I’ll now focus on wallet transactions & payment processing, ensuring secure money transfers within SmartPay. Stay tuned! 🚀
